He adds that âtailwinds remain strongâ as orders accelerate into the end of the year. Moreover, he highlights Nvidiaâs deal with the U.S. government that clears the way for H20 chip sales in China, which he estimates could bring in roughly 15% of revenue going forward.\nIs Nvidia Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\nOn the Street, sentiment remains bullish. Out of 38 analysts covering the stock, 34 rate the stock a Buy, while only one has an Underperform rating. The average price target stands at $196.65, suggesting a potential upside of 12.12% from the current price.",
