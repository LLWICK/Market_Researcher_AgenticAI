  "content": "The first quarter of 2025 witnessed a remarkable surge in global battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales, with an impressive year-on-year growth of 42%. This increase propelled the global BEV market share to a record-breaking 16% for Q1.\nChina played a pivotal role in this growth, accounting for over 60% of worldwide BEV sales and establishing its dominance in the electric mobility market. Supported by ongoing government stimulus measures, BEV sales in China soared by 55% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. This rise resulted in China's highest-ever BEV market share for Q1, reaching 27%.\nAnalyzing global plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales presents a similar trend. PHEV sales in Q1 2025 grew by 27% year-on-year, primarily driven by a 37% increase in China. Together, these growing sectors in electric mobility contributed to over 4 million units sold across 40 markets in the first quarter.\nIn Europe, the top five markets experienced a resurgence in BEV sales after a temporary dip, rebounding by 30% following three consecutive quarters of decline. The United Kingdom and Germany led this recovery, showcasing significant growth of 43% and 39%, respectively.\nDespite this considerable expansion in electric vehicle adoption, the pace of automotive electrification has been slower than some experts anticipated. Global geopolitical challenges continue to complicate progress toward widespread electric mobility.\nPwC AutofactsÂ® and Strategy& have analyzed electric vehicle sales worldwide in the first quarter of 2025.\nSteven van Arsdale also contributed to this report.",
