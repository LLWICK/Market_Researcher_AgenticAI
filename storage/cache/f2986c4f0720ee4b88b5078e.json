  "content": "In 2024, global sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) experienced significant growth, increasing by 14% compared to the previous year. This rise was primarily driven by the continued strength and dominance of the Chinese market, which expanded by 20% over the year.\nThe fourth quarter saw exceptional growth in China for both BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). For the first time, BEV sales in the country surpassed two million in a single quarter, nearly reaching 2.5 million. PHEV sales also surged, growing by an impressive 78% in Q4 2024 compared to Q4 2023. In the United States, BEV sales in the fourth quarter appeared to benefit from the perception that current incentives might soon be reduced or eliminated, possibly influenced by the newly inaugurated President.\nConversely, the year-end had a negative impact on some other markets. BEV sales in the top five European markets decreased by 5% in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This decline may be attributed to OEMs delaying registrations to meet stricter CO2 emissions targets set to begin in the EU in January 2025.\nPwC AutofactsÂ® and Strategy& have analyzed electric vehicle sales worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nSteven van Arsdale also contributed to this report.",
