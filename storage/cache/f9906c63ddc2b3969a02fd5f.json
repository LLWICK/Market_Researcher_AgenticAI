Stock Analysis, Nvidia earns a solid score of 84 out of 100 with an Outperform rating. Notably, the tool highlights both the positive and negative factors influencing the companyâs stock performance.\nAmong the positive factors, AI demand remains strong, fueled by heavy investments from hyperscale companies and additional momentum from new Sovereign AI partnerships. On the earnings front, Nvidiaâs management expects initial shipments of its GB300 this quarter, with a larger production ramp coming in the following quarters. Together, these factors are set to support solid double-digit revenue growth.\nOn the bearish side, Nvidia faces geopolitical risks, including a potential 15% tax on AI exports and rising pressure for China to shift toward domestic AI chips. This could weigh on its guidance. Additionally, demand for Nvidiaâs latest chips continues to outpace supply, creating short-term challenges in meeting orders.\nWall Street also Stays Bullish on NVDA ahead of Q2 Earnings\nOverall, analysts project Nvidia will post Q2 earnings of $1.01 per share, marking a 47% jump from last year. Meanwhile, revenue is expected to reach $45.9 billion, according to the TipRanks Analyst Forecasts Page.\nFurthermore, multiple analysts have raised their price targets on NVDA stock ahead of the Q2 print. Most recently, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised NVDAâs price target from $175 to $210. Bryson cited booming hyperscale AI spending, steady demand for GPUs, and a potential rebound in China sales as key drivers for Nvidiaâs growth.\nSimilarly, five-star-rated analyst John Vinh at KeyBanc raised his price target on Nvidia to $215 from $190 while maintaining a Buy rating. He expects strong July-quarter results but cautions that guidance for the October quarter may come in softer.\nWhat Is the Target for Nvidia Stock?\nAccording to TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 35 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. At $197.89 the Nvidia average share price target implies a 13.09% upside potential.\nYear-to-date, NVDA stock has gained 30.3%.",
