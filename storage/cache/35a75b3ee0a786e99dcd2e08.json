  "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\nAug 22 - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) enters its Aug. 27, 2025 earnings report riding strong momentum. Wall Street models forecast roughly $45.9B in Q2 revenue and about $1.00$1.01 in EPS, driven by robust AI demand and initial GB300 shipments. Several top analysts raised targets ahead of the print. For example, Wedbush bumped its target to $210 and KeyBanc to $215, signaling analyst confidence and implying double-digit upside.\nBull case: Nvidia still dominates AI datacenter GPUs, enjoys strong hyperscaler spending, and may beat lofty estimates again. That combination can spark an immediate post-earnings rally if guidance holds or improves.\nRisk case: Geopolitics and export rules (and the company's talks with U.S. officials over China-specific chips) add uncertainty; supply and short-term guidance could disappoint, and valuation already prices much optimism.\nAnalyst's Opinion on NVDA Stock\nBased on the consensus recommendation from 65 brokerage firms, NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) average brokerage recommendation is currently 1.8, indicating a \"Outperform\" status.
