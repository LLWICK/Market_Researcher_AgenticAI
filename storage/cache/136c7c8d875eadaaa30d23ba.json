The market is loaded with choices that come with screens ranging from 14 to 18 inches graphics cards that can handle a variety of resolutions and options for any budget, from entry-level up to maxed out, multi-thousand dollar rigs The best gaming laptops often come with fancy RGB lights, high refresh rate panels and, sometimes, even mechanical keyboards.\nTo help you choose the right gaming laptop, we test many models each year, benchmarking them in popular games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2.\nFor those on a tight gaming budget, we also have dedicated pages for the best gaming laptops under $1,500 and the best gaming laptops under $1,000.\nWe've started testing the latest components for 2025, including Intel's latest Core Ultra CPUs and Nvidia's \"Blackwell\" mobile GPUs. While we're always excited for the next generation of gaming notebooks, those RTX 50-series GPUs haven't made our list yet. Our review of the Razer Blade 16 revealed some driver issues that we're waiting for Nvidia to fix. We're testing more and hope to see those updated soon so that we can add more new picks to this page.\nWe're also seeing a renaissance in integrated graphics in gaming handhelds, which might lead some companies to see how far they can push systems without discrete GPUs altogether. That means over the next few months, we should see a bunch of refreshed gaming laptops for playing on the go.\nAndrew is a Senior Editor on Tom's Hardware covering systems, including gaming laptops, gaming PCs, consoles, and handhelds. He has been reviewing hardware and laptops for 10 years.\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nThe Best Gaming Laptop\nMSI’s latest Titan delivers chart-topping performance, an extremely vibrant screen, and 6TB of SSD storage. Its loud fans and brief battery life are to be expected — this is a gaming dream machine for those who can afford it.\nBest Budget\nBest Budget Gaming Laptop\nThe MSI Katana HX stands is the rare gaming laptop we've tested under $1,000. The combination of an Intel Core i7 and Nvidia RTX 5050 makes for solid 1080p performance on a laptop, and you even get four-zone RGB lighting. The dim, bland, 15.6-inch, display, however, is a serious trade-off.\nMid-range value\nMid-range value\nIf you find this model on sale as we did at $1,599, you get great specs for the price, including an Intel Core i7-14650HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It's enough to power the laptop's very pretty 2560 x 1600 display.\nShow More ⬇\nBest 14-inch\nBest 14-inch Laptop\nAsus' TUF Gaming A14 feels premium, looks grown-up, and delivers great battery life for non-gaming tasks. For truly portable gaming, this AMD and Nvidia-based pick is a strong choice.\nBest Desktop Replacement\nThe Alienware 16 Area-51 is a hefty gaming laptop with a ton of power and the option for an excellent keyboard, which is good if you want to keep your whole setup in one system. At 7.49 pounds and 1.12 inches thick, this is a system that you can carry around, but may want to just leave in your home.\nBest Gaming Laptops 2025\nWhy you can trust Tom's Hardware\nThe Best Gaming Laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n✅ You want a very high-res display: Very few gaming laptops offer screens higher than 2560 x 1440. The Mini-LED screen on the Titan goes up to 3840 x 2400 at 120 Hz.\n✅ You love clicky keys: The Cherry MX keyboard on the Titan is luxurious, though the number pad and arrow keys still use membranes.\n❌ You can't afford it: The Titan is prohibitively expensive. We tested it at $6,379, which is a lot to spend on a gaming laptop.\n❌ You want to take it on the go: This desktop replacement is large, heavy, and doesn't have long battery life. It's really designed to be plugged in.\nThe MSI Titan 18 HX AI better be the best gaming laptop. At $6,379 as tested, it pulls out all of the stops, including the most powerful Intel and Nvidia chips on offer, a mechanical keyboard, and a ton of storage space.\nThe system offers exceptional gaming performance on a laptop, though even the RTX 5090 may not always be able to pull off playing games at native resolution without the help of DLSS or turning down some settings. When I played games on it, I found you're likely better adjusting the resolution.\nThe Cherry MX mechanical keyboard is a luxury found on few laptops, though it's about time for MSI to expand it so that it includes the arrow keys and the numberpad. Still, most gaming and typing feel absolutely fantastic.\nConnectivity is incredible. The system has three SSDs adding up to 6TB of storage in our review model. If that doesn't hold your game collection, there are also Thunderbolt 5 ports for some of the fastest external storage drives around.\nIf you value battery life, though, the Raider might not be for you. In our testing, it ran 2 hours and 16 minutes in our rundown. In a coffee shop with the brightness pulled up, it did even worse. This is a system that's mean to be plugged in.\nThe Mini-LED display is also gorgeous. It goes up to 3840 x 2400, which is rare on gaming laptops these days. While it's not OLED, I think it's an excellent screen that makes games and work alike look great.\nBut this price is out of reach for many. If that's the case, keep scrolling — we have plenty of picks at more affordable prices.\nRead: MSI Titan 18 HX AI Raider review\nThe Best Budget Gaming Laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n✅You can't spend more than $1,000: The MSI Katana 15 HX is $999.99 as tested, just falling beneath the threshold.\n✅You want to upgrade down the line: The SSD, RAM, and Wi-Fi card are all slotted.\n❌The display is the most important thing: The 15.6-inch screen is dim and washed out, making many games look lifeless.\nIt's rare to see a truly budget gaming laptop — one under $1,000— these days, especially with a current-generation GPU. Right now, the best of these that we've tested is the MSI Katana 15 HX, which pairs a low-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 and a 14th Gen Intel Core i7 HX-series processor.\nThis system, which is $999.99 as tested, offered solid 1080p gaming performance on our suite of benchmarks, and could deliver even more frames on less taxing settings.\nThere are some other extras here. I appreciate the a system this cheap has slotted RAM and an easily replaceable SSD so the system can grow with you. Additionally, MSI put in a four-zone RGB keyboard, while many laptops at this price might not have RGB at all, or only offer a single color.\nThe biggest drawback to this machine is its screen. The 15.6-inch, 1080p panel is dim and bland, measure just 257 nits of brightness on our light meter and covering 69.3% of the sRGB gamut by volume. Games and videos alike looked pretty dull.\nRead: MSI Katana 15 HX\nMid-range value\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n✅ The screen is important to you: The 16-inch, 2560 x 1600 proved to be vibrant in our testing, with beautiful colors and deep contrast.\n✅ You want to add storage later: This laptop has room for you to add a second SSD down the line.\n❌ You want inuitive software: Gigabyte's Control Center isn't the easiest to use when you want to make changes in settings.\nAt $1,599.99 as tested, the Gigabyte Aorus 16X packs a lot of features into its 16-inch frame.\nThe laptop has a vibrant, 2560 x 1600 display that runs at 165 Hz for smooth first person shooters and esports. Its Core i7-14650HX CPU and GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card effortlessly handle games on the great display, and its built-in speakers are good enough that I didn't have to worry about headphones in a pinch.\nOn the practical side, it has a comfortable mouse and keyboard, excellent connectivity (including Thunderbolt 4 and Wi-Fi 7), and biometric security from its IR webcam. A surprising number of midrange gaming notebooks forego biometrics entirely, so I appreciated these security features.\nYou'll still want to carry a charger around, and Gigabyte's software isn't exactly the most intuitive. But if you want powerful gaming on a nice screen for a decent price, it's hard to argue with what's being offered here.\nRead: Gigabyte Aorus 16X review\nBest 14-inch Laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n✅ You want a great gaming device you can take with you: At just 3.22 pounds and 0.78 inches thick, the TUF Gaming A14 competes with ultrabooks on size\n❌ You want to play games without headphones: In our testing, the speakers were a weak point on this system, so you'll want some earbuds or a headset.\nWhile Asus has often treated its TUF Gaming brand as a budget lineup, the A14 sure feels premium. In fact, it's my favorite 14-inch laptop that we've recently tested, standing out in a suddenly-crowded category.\nIts understated design seems to borrow from the more upscale Zephyrus lineup. Despite packing an RTX 4060 in our review configuration, the TUF is just 3.22 pounds and 0.78 inches thick, putting it in line with some ultrabooks.\nWhen we weren't using it for gaming, the A14 used Nvidia's Advanced Optimus and switched to the integrated graphics, managing to squeeze out 10 hours and 4 minutes of life on our battery test, which involves web browsing, streaming, and browser-based graphics tests.\nThe speakers are a bit quiet, but we appreciated the travel-friendly design. The 100W RTX 4060 can only play games at moderate settings, but if you're on the go, the A14 is a great option.\nRead: Asus TUF Gaming A14 review\nThe Best Desktop Replacement\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n✅ You want a laptop with a mechanical keyboard: The Cherry MX keyboard on the Area-51 feels great for typing and gaming.\n✅ You want powerful performance: The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX powering our review units tore through benchmarks.\n❌ You want to carry your laptop around: Even this 16-inch notebook is a hefty and I had a hard time fitting it in my backpack.\n❌ You want OLED: Despite the price, Alienware isn't offering OLED display options with the most vivid colors and deepest blacks.\nDesktop replacements are usually fairly permanent fixtures on your desk. The Alienware 16 Area-51 is a hefty gaming laptop with a ton of power and the option for an excellent keyboard, which is good if you want to keep your whole setup in one system. At 7.49 pounds and 1.12 inches thick, this is a system that you can carry around, but may want to just leave in your home.\nMany desktop replacements are 18 inches. If that's your preference, there's an Alienware 18 Area-51 as well, but we haven't gotten to test that yet.\nThe system is built solid and comes in a novel \"liquid teal\" color. The $50 mechanical keyboard option is totally worth it; I love the way it feels. If you want to upgrade it down the line, the 16-incher has three M.2 SSD slots and slotted RAM, though the Wi-Fi is soldered.\nPerformance was strong, too, with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX powering through our benchmarks, often delivering higher performance than the Razer Blade 16's RTX 5090 paired with a 28W AMD CPU.\nThe display is nice and bright, but at this price, Alienware should have OLED options. And while gaming laptops typically don't last all day on a charge, the Area-51 lasted only 4 hours and 10 minutes on a charge, far shorter than some competitors.\nRead: Alienware 16 Area-51 review\nOther Gaming Laptops We Tested\n💻 Asus ROG Strix G16\nA powerful gaming laptop boasting an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU and a fast, colorful display. It's Ryzen 9995HX3D's X3D adds more benefit for productivity performance than gaming. It didn't hit the list, but it's worth a look.\nRead: Asus ROG Strix G16 review\n💻 Gigabyte Aorus Master 16\nThe Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is a strong gaming laptop with an Nvidia RTX 5080 Laptop GPU and a bright display, but it doesn't feel as premium as its price tag, and its GiMate AI doesn't add much.\nRead: Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 review\n💻 Razer Blade 16\nThe Razer Blade 16 is a thin RTX 5090 laptop with a bright screen and tons of ports, but it's extremely pricey and the drivers felt unfinished on our test unit.\nRead: Razer Blade 16 review\n💻 Acer Predator Helios Neo Slim 14\nThis 14.5-inch Predator gaming laptop delivers good 1600p gaming performance and plentiful features, including Thunderbolt 4 and RGB backlighting.\nRead: Acer Predator Helios Neo Slim 14 review\nHow We Test Gaming Laptops\nEvery gaming laptop that we review goes through a rigorous series of tests and benchmarks to decide whether it's worth your consideration.\nCurrently, games that we run and may include in our reviews are:\nWe also run a stress test, which currently consists of the Metro Exodus benchmark on the RTX preset, run 15 times in a loop while recording system statistics with HWInfo. (This is also when we take our heat tests).\nAdditionally, we run a series of productivity benchmarks, including Geekbench, Handbrake, and our in-house file transfer test. These test both single-core and multi-core performance on the processor, as well as all-around performance.\nWe measure gaming laptop displays with our colorimeter and light meter, and report brightness in nits, as well as the volume of the DCI-P3 and sRGB color gamut that the screen covers.\nOur battery test connects to a local web server over Wi-Fi, and continuously browses the web, runs simple OpenGL graphics tests, and streams videos. We report the amount of time the laptop ran the test in hours and minutes.\nBenchmarks aren't everything. We also actually use the gaming laptops that we review. Our writers and editors spend time playing games and using gaming laptops for writing, watching videos, listening to music, and browsing the web. This gives us the experience to report our own thoughts and feelings about the keyboard, design, port selection, audio, and other features. It also helps us get some valuable play time in!\nBecause the ability to upgrade and repair gaming laptops is essential, we open every system to see which parts are user-replaceable and document that experience so you know what you can change down the line and how difficult (or easy!) that is for you to do..\nGaming Laptop FAQs\n◼ Are gaming laptops worth it?\nIf you want to play games on your laptop, then yes! While you can run some games on integrated graphics found in most laptops, a gaming laptop with a discrete graphics card, a high-end CPU, and powerful cooling can help you achieve strong gaming performance on the go. These systems often also include higher refresh rate displays and more ports for your peripherals. There are gaming laptops at a variety of price points, from budget entries up through systems that cost over $5,000.\n◼ Can you upgrade gaming laptops?\nThis varies from system to system, but most gaming laptops offer some degree of aftermarket upgradeability. At the very least, many machines let you put in a bigger (or second) SSD, which is good because games are huge. Thinner laptops might have the RAM soldered down, though many still have replaceable SO-DIMMs. CPUs and GPUs are always soldered down.\n◼ Which GPU should I get?\nMost games are heavily dependent on the GPU, so you should invest here if you can. While 50-series gaming laptops are rolling out, the 40-series still holds great value. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and 4090 will give you top-end performance that should leave you gaming comfortably for a few years, while the RTX 4070 is a fine mid-range card. The 4060, when on sale, can be a great deal, including in gaming laptops under $1,500. The 50-class cards might give you some extra oomph, but you're usually better off waiting for a 4060 to go on sale.\nAMD's GPUs have significantly less market share in gaming laptops than Nvidia's chips.\n◼ What size screen should I get for a gaming laptop? What about refresh rate?\nThe size screen you chose for a gaming laptop is largely based on personal preference. Smaller, 14-inch laptops are easier to carry around, but larger 17 or-18 inch notebooks are more likely to also feature large cooling systems that can cool more powerful graphics cards.\nHigh refresh rate is nice, but the fastest options, going up to 360 Hz, see the biggest benefits in esports games that require quick-twitch skills and are often played at lower settings.\nIf you have a more powerful GPU, you may opt for a higher resolution screen to take advantage of it. 2560 x 1600 seems to be a sweet spot these days.\n◼ Can gaming laptops be used for work and video editing?\nGaming laptops aren't limited to gaming. Most of what we review uses Windows 11, so you get everything that comes with it. There's no reason you couldn't do anything you do on the best ultrabooks with them. We test all gaming laptops with a suite of productivity tests.\nA GPU may be especially helpful for intense tasks like video editing, photo editing, and rendering.\n◼ What is battery life like on gaming laptops?\nGaming laptops typically don't offer battery life on par with ultrabooks. We often see less than 8 hours on a charge when you aren't even gaming, though we've seen some strong times from AMD's Ryzen processors, and Nvidia suggests its improved Optimus technology may help turn the tide.\nWe don't typically recommend gaming on battery, but if you do, that will depend heavily on the game. A 2D side-scroller should chew through less battery life than a massive first-person shooter with all of the effects turned up.\nGaming Laptop Shopping Tips\n🛒 Focus on the GPU\nMost games are heavily dependent on the GPU, and those aren’t upgradeable. If you splurge on a powerful GPU now, you’ll be gaming comfortably for a few years.\n🛒 You can upgrade some parts later\nWhile the best CPUs for gaming and GPUs are almost always soldered down, most gaming laptops let you replace the RAM and storage, so you can buy cheaper now and add more memory and a bigger best hard drive or SSD down the road. Thicker, more powerful laptops are often easier to upgrade than thinner ones, so be sure to do some research before buying. (We include this information in our reviews.)\n🛒 Battery life will probably be bad\nVery few gaming notebooks get 8 hours or more on a charge, and you need the power supply to get the best gaming performance anyway. However, we've seen some strong times from AMD's Ryzen processors, and Nvidia suggests its improved Optimus technology may help turn the tide. For peak gaming performance, however, you'll want to be sure to be plugged in while playing.\n🛒 Get enough storage for your games\nVideo games take up more storage than ever, and premium gaming laptops are expensive. Shy away from anything less than 512GB. 1TB is the sweet spot and 2TB is ideal for a gaming laptop. Luckily, most machines let you add more storage down the line if you need it\nDiscounts on the Best Gaming Laptops\nWhether you're shopping for one of the best gaming laptops or another model that didn't quite make our list, you may find some savings by checking out our list of the best gaming laptop deals.

You can send him tips on Signal: andrewfreedman.01\n-\nRagerokit This article has links to laptops with (deceptively) lower specs than those reviewed ie aorus links to a laptop with only 16gb ram a lot of buyers might miss that sort of change especially when the model number remains the same.Reply -\nibrust777 It'd be nice if in these gaming laptop reviews you included some information about the temps the CPU reached during testing. I've had many cooling problems with gaming laptops, often making certain games unplayable despite the GPU / CPU being capable of running it.Reply -\nStomx The laptop world is a perfect example of price mongering.Reply\nGo to any decent BestBuy in large city. There you will find 3-4 distinct areas for the laptops: really large decent section of Chromebooks for $200, the Mac section with $1-2k, the standard Windows laptops for $0.5-1 k and the gaming section starting with $2k and goes to $5k and even 8k. You will scratch your head thinking how manufacturers succeeded with $200 Chromebooks and what is so special inside the game laptops to cost $5000 ???\nBut those who are long with the PCs and knows how many processors are on a single wafer, how much TSMC charges for one wafer to develop, what are discounts when you buy processors by millions, how prices on new stuff quickly drop with time etc, understand that the only what makes the price difference between all of them is GPU which costs less than $100-200 to produce (the CPU itself is even much less than a $100). So the Bill-of-Materials (BoM) for the manufacturers of the most expensive game laptops is likely barely $1K at the most.\nThen why these prices are that crazy (and do not forget to lift to feel the titanic weight of the Titan laptop!)? That reminds us that we are living at the times of AI Klondike, when the rivers of money flow into some hands of those who develop AI and the shops are fishing in the pockets of such people",
