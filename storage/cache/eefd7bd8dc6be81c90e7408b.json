We saw some minor sell signals on August 1, but they have been erased. The major indices rallied last week, albeit in choppy fashion, with up days on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and down days on Tuesday and Thursday. The sell signals and warnings that we had on August 1 included a bearish crossover of the five-day- and 13-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), a break of the 21-day EMA, and the cycling of the Vortex indicator into negative territory. In addition, price volatility picked up following the July 31 bearish reversal, and that can be a bad sign after a big advance. The 21-day rate of change (ROC) got very close to cycling into negative territory before popping last week. We still have two bearish divergences on the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) after cycling into extreme overbought territory -- a warning, but not a sell signal. For now, it looks like the major indices could be at the start of another leg higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) just missing a closing all-time high on Friday and the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 reaching closing highs. The Commitment of Traders (COT) data for the SPX remains bullish, but is bearish for the Nasdaq 100. The data for the volatility index (VIX) is bullish, suggesting we could see another move higher and then an eventual pullback in the stock market. Over the weekend, Ethereum broke out of a base going back to March 2024 and is close to all-time highs, while Bitcoin broke out of a flag on Sunday and also is near to all-time highs.

The sites enable users to communicate with friends and family by posting to the site; to comment on others' posts; to share photographs, website links, and videos; to message; and to play games. The company also partners with application developers to add functionality to the sites, and allows users to pay for virtual goods and services through its Payments function. Meta derives about 55% of its revenue from outside the U.S. and Canada.\nRatingPrice TargetStocks are higher at Monday midday.

The odds of a Fed rate cut in September are now 85%, a big reversal from Friday morning before the release of the Jobs report. That data has economists rethinking the strength of the labor market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.22%, a big drop from last week. Crude oil is at $66 per barrel.\nMeta Earnings: Ad Engine Firing on All Cylinders Even as AI Costs Mount; FVE up to $850 From $770\nMeta is the largest social media company in the world, boasting close to 4 billion monthly active users worldwide. The firm's \"Family of Apps,\" its core business, consists of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. End users can leverage these applications for a variety of different purposes, from keeping in touch with friends to following celebrities and running digital businesses for free. Meta packages customer data, gleaned from its application ecosystem and sells ads to digital advertisers. While the firm has been investing heavily in its Reality Labs business, it remains a very small part of Metaâ€™s overall sales.\nRatingPrice Target\nTop Analysts: META\nView MoreOverall Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest for META overall weighted by direction, price target, and price movement.\nLearn MoreDirection Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the directional movement of META.\nLearn MorePrice Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the price target of META.\nLearn More",
